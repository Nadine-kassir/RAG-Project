# Breast Cancer Chatbot - RAG Project

## Project Overview
This project is a **Breast Cancer Chatbot** built using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.  
The chatbot allows users to ask questions about breast cancer and receive accurate, context-aware responses based on trusted medical literature, including PDF articles from PubMed.

> The project is designed to **grow over time**: new PDF documents or research articles can be added to improve the knowledge base, making the chatbot more robust and up-to-date.
